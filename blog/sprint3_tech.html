         <h4>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h4>
             <p>
                A good analogy is of a journalist and his or her boss-the editor. The journalist write a story 
                and the editor uses a red pen and "makrs up" all the text that needs attention. For example, 
                a circle might be drawn around a word with "i"(for "italics") noted in the margin.
                The journalist receives the story back and can make sense of the editor's notes, because in the publishing world there 
                is a set of rules for such text editing.
             </p>

         <h4>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h4>
             <p>    
                    The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
                    Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. They repeat an action some number of times.
                   
                    The control flow and loop can be illustrated by getting the kids ready for school every day. The order of events (congtrol flow) is as follows.
                    After waking up the kids at 7:30am, I preapare their lunch, while they get dressed, then I provide them breakfast, the kids eat breakfast, after which 
                    the children brush their teeth, wash face, put their lunch in their bags, put their bags on, go the car, I drive the car to school, drop off the children,
                    drive back home. This is carried out everyday from Monday to Friday, like a continuious loop.
             </p>

         <h4>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h4>
              <p>
                    - The DOM is an 'application programming interface' <br>
                    - Use the DOM when we interact with web pages <br>
                    - Add content to a HTML document <br>
                    - Delete content from a HTML document <br>
                    - Change content on a HTML document <br>
                   
                   
             </p>

         <h4>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.c</h4>
              <p>
                    JavaScript has only one data type which can contain multiple values: Object. An Array is a special form of object.
                    
                    (Plain) Objects have the form-{key: value, key: value, ...}
                    Arrays have the form-[value, value, ...]
             </p>

         <h4>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h4>
         <p>
               - A function is a subprogram designed to perform a particular task. <br>
                -Functions are executed when they are called. This is known as invoking a function. <br>
                -Values can be passed into functions and used within the function. <br>
                -Functions always return a value. In JavaScript, if no return value is specified, the function will return undefined.<br>
                -Functions are objects. <br>

                You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
                You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.
