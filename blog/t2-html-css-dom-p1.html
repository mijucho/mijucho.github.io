         <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
          <p>
            A good analogy is of a journalist and his or her boss-the editor. The journalist write a story 
            and the editor uses a red pen and "makrs up" all the text that needs attention. For example, 
            a circle might be drawn around a word with "i"(for "italics") noted in the margin.
            The journalist receives the story back and can make sense of the editor's notes, because in the publishing world there 
            is a set of rules for such text editing.

            The Dom is a kind of journalist assistace or tools that hleps jouranlist to write 
            easly.

          <h3> What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
           <p>Boxifying design means dividing all the HTML elements in boxes. 
             You can starting boxifying your design by putting the whole page in a big box, then break down each part of the page  
             into smaller boxes making your way into each HTML element.

            </p>
       

          <h3>What is the box model</h3>
           <p> Any HTML element can be considered a box, and so the box model applies to all HTML elements for the design and layout.
          It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model:</p>
