         <h4>Your values are the things that you believe are important in the way you live and work.</h4>
         <h4> My main values are:</h4> 
           <h4> Happiness  Contribution  Carefulness  Hardworking   Openness  Honesty</h4>

         <h4>	Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values
           involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h4>
          <p>
              I am a mum with two kids who are nine years old girl and six years old boy. After married and kids were young,
               I haven't had a time to look after myself. Once kids went to school, I had more time to think about life. 
               After much thought, I thought I might like to be interested in web design and development. 
               Now I am here to begin my journey in Dev Academy. When I studied at Yoobee School of Design, 
               we had a team project to design a tracking App. There were three members in our teams and we had a weeks to 
               finish the project. We divided it into three different roles and we become a leader of each roles.
               End of the first week, we heard that one of our team number's mum was in the hospital and her conditions
                wasn't good so our team member had to go to Auckland. We all understand her situation so that me and another
                team member  to extra works. It can be quite a hard situation in our team, because of my personal values to 
                work hard, working in a team, and having sympathy towards the personal needs of one of the members, it was so 
                much of an issue to me. Another time, we had a personal project for a packaging design for a baby product. 
                I found a really nice design pattern from a Korean baby product. I was quite tempted to copy it. However, 
                I wasn't comfortable deep within. Due to my ethical view, I decided not to copy this design, 
                instead I designed my own unique packaging design. It wasn't as nice as the other design, 
                but I was happy and satisfied with my own design from my own research and effort.

            <h4>	Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h4>
            <p>
                My Korean culture is family orientated and has an emphases on communal living. Also I've learnt to have an
                 attitude to respect the elders. On top of this, we have a hard working culture. Since I was young I spent a
                  lot of time with not only my family but also relatives. In such environment I've spontaneously learnt to 
                  care for others, have a sympathetic heart and a view to always spend time together.
                   Although having a big family cause us to be comparative, we do it to have  fun and we do it out of love.
