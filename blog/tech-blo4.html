              <h3>Problem-Solving</h3>

                <p>
                My main cahllenege that I am lacking understanding of the concepts and impementating it.
                When we have a task such as gradebook kata challenge, it took a while to understand the task an to write evern a pseudocode.

                I used google to get help mainly and fine someone to get help too.  I felt overwhelmed and uneasiness during the process, but one thing 
                I've learn that I need to set a samll goal or task and work through step by step. When I see a task itself, it seems like a big mountain which is impossible to climb up.
                However, if I set a samll task and try to finish it, it gives me small achivement and it will motivate me to finish the journey.

               </p>
               <h4> Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques</h4>
               <p>
               Pseudocode was good start when I code. It helps me break down my plan into small steps before I get into writing the code. <br>
               Googling was most frequently used. If I have a chance I asked my peers for help and coaches for help. That's really helpful.<br>
              
               Some techniques are not really feamiliar with such as Rubber ducky method, Console.logging,  Reading error messages.
               but I feel I am on the process of leaning so I hope I can be better in this masster of problem-solving.
