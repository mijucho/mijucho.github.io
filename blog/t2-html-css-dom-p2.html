            <h4>What is grid based design?</h4>
  
               <p>
                  A grid-based design is one that works in and around the constraints of a row-and-column-based grid system 
                  to help keep your content nicely aligned.
               </p>
      

            <h4>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h4>
               <p>
                 Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user’s behavior
                   and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation. The practice consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts,
                  images and an intelligent use of CSS media queries.
              </p>
       

          <h4>What is semantic structure?</h4>
             <p>
                Semantic structure is a way of writing and structuring your HTML so that it reinforces the semantics of the content rather 
                than its appearance. They’re chosen based on the importance and structure of the content.
                While HTML has included semantic markup from the beginning, the advent of HTML5 brought with it even more semantic tags 
                such as 'section', 'article', 'footer', 'nav', and 'aside'. 
                The goal is to make it easier for browsers, developers, and crawlers to distinguish between different types of data.
                All of these semantic tags make it clearer what information is on the webpage as well as its importance.
       
             </p>
          <h4> Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on. </h4>
              <p>
                Bootstrap seems interesting and useful tool. "Bootstrap makes front-end web development faster and easier. It's made for folks of all skill levels,
                devices of all shapes, and projects of all sizes."
