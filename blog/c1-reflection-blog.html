        <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience? </h3>
           <p>
            There is  an encouraging atmosphere for the learning. 
            So good to see the other people that who has passionate  about what they are doing.
            </p>

           <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
            <p>
            It was quite a different style of learning for me so it took a while to get used to it. 
            However I like "kitchen and create mind set" which is where we all can particiape to cook and experiment together.
            </p>

           <h3>How do you see yourself Engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
            <p>
            I am a slow learner but I am open minded. I am willing to adjust to a new learning envionment with others.

            </p>

          <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
            <p>
              No~~ I am happy with EDA
            </p>
           <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
            <p>
              I am excited at the same nervous as well.
