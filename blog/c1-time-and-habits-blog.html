  <h2> Time and Habits </h2>

    <h3> which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
       
      <p>
            I haven’t tried time box yet however I used the Toggle to check my time sending and using on my task.  I tried to set up small goal to achieve for a task. I also do Yoga, Walking, and going to gym to refresh myself. 
      </p>

     <h3>  what did you find interesting?</h3>


       <p>Both Meditation and Pomodoro Technique were quite interesting. Meditation has lots of benefits such as Better focus, less anxiety, more creativity and compassion, more creativity, less stress 

        Pomodoro Technique-focus on one thing for 25 minutes then take a five minute break. it’s about learning how you work so you can save time in the future.</p>

     <h3>what worked for you?</h3>


        <p>When I tried to finish the small task, it gives me confident and achievement. To achieve goals, I need focus on the small step, not the goal itself. Small steps are clearly defined actions.﻿</p>

    <h3>which will you experiment further with?</h3>


       <p>I like to Meditation and Pomodoro Technique</p>
