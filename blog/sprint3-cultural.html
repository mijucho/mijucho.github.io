         <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
             <p>
                Emotional Intelligence (EQ or EI) is a term created by two researchers -Peter Salavoy and John Mayer - and 
                popularized by Dan Goleman in his 1996 book of the same name.<br>
                We define EI as the ability to understand and manage our own emotions and understand and influence the emotions of others<br>
                 Emotional Intelligence is made up of 4 main core skills :<br>
                 Self-Awareness: your ability to perceive your own emotions accurately and be aware of them as they happen no matter what.<br>
                 Self-Management: your ability to build upon your awareness of your own emotions to stay positive and productive regardless of what happens.<br>
                 Social Awareness: your ability to read and understand other people's emotions, and really understand what's going on inside them.<br>
                 Relationship Management: your ability to use awareness of your own emotions and other people's emotions to manage interactions successfully.<br>

             </p>
           
         <h4>How is it different to IQ?</h4>
         IQ represents abilities such as:	EQ is centered on abilities such as:

         	Visual and spatial processing
         	Knowledge of the world
         	Fluid reasoning
         	Working memory and short-term memory
         	Quantitative reasoning	
         	Identifying emotions
         	Evaluating how others feel
         	Controlling one's own emotions
         	Perceiving how others feel
         	Using emotions to facilitate social communication
         	Relating to others
                 
         <h4>Why is it important?</h4>
         In his book Emotional Intelligence, Daniel Goleman, writes "people with well-developed emotional skills are more likely to be content 
         and effective in their lives, mastering the habits of the mind that foster their own productivity; whereas people who 
         cannot marshal some control over their emotional life will fight inner battles that sabotage their ability for
          focused work and clear thought." <br>
          As a result, people with high emotional intelligence: <br>
          1.	Build stronger personal relationships<br>
          2.	Find more success at work<br>
          3.	Effectively handle life's challenges<br>
